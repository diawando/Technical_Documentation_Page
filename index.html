             <p>
                JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
                It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser),
                JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
            </p>
            <p>
                JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math,
                and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements.
                Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional
                 objects; for example:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a 
                    browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow 
                    an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks,
                     form input, and page navigation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server.
                     For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information 
                     from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
                </li>
            </ul>
